# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, this LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 

This app is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

On the node.js commnand line, the following commands yield the following results:

"Concert-this":  Uses Bands in Town API to fetch and display concert data based on band name provided by user

"Spotify-this-song":  As the name suggests, this taps into Spotify's library to display song data based on User's search query

"Movie-this":  Uses OMDB API to fetch and display movie data based movie name provided by user
